#Misandry...The Trivia Game!

How much do you really know about misandry? 

Test your knowledge with this trivia game! 

You will be asked a series of multiple choice & true/false questions about all things misandry. Do you feel confident? Great! But beware, you only have three opportunities to answer incorrectly before the game is over, at which point you will receive your score- what category do you fall into;

Are you a full-on FemiNazi? An honorary Mens Right Activist? Or perhaps a female chauvanist?

Test your knowledge with this slick trivia application and brag to your friends about how much you know about the manifestation of man hate! :-)

#Design Approach
---
The design for Misandry..The Trivia Game! is heavily influenced by this t-shirt, which I recieved as a birthday gift from a dear friend: 

![a tishirt with a big pink heart on the front with 'Misandry' printed inside of it](file:///Users/claire/code/Project01_MisandryTrivia/assets/tee%20logo.jpg)

The font on this shirt reminds me of one of my favorite childhood toys; more specifically, it brings to mind the font used for the Barbie brand:

The color pallet and font informed all of the design choices; from the background art, to the font color, to the logo design.
